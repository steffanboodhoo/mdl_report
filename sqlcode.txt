1)How many unique schools are registered to the system

select name from mdl_cohort;


2)How many students are registered for each school

Create a view to store total students of each cohort group

select 
	cm.cohortid,count(cm.userid),m.name
from
	mdl_cohort_members cm, mdl_role_assignments r, mdl_cohort m
where 
	r.roleid = 5 and r.userid = cm.userid
	and m.id = cm.cohortid
group by cm.cohortid;

--------------------------------------SOLUTION
-------OPT 1
create or replace view total_student_cohort_usage as (
select 
	cm.cohortid, count(l.userid)
from 
	mdl_logstore_standard_log l, mdl_role_assignments r, mdl_cohort_members cm
where 
	l.userid = r.userid and r.roleid=5
	and l.userid = cm.userid
group by cm.cohortid
);

select name,id from mdl_cohort;
-------OPT 2
create or replace view total_student_cohort_usage as (
select 
	cm.cohortid, count(l.userid), c.name
from 
	mdl_logstore_standard_log l, mdl_role_assignments r, mdl_cohort_members cm, mdl_cohort c
where 
	l.userid = r.userid and r.roleid=5
	and l.userid = cm.userid
	and c.id = cm.cohortid
group by cm.cohortid
);

3)
how many students actively use the system?

what defines active
how many times Ki has a student i used the system [between the intervals t1,t2]
which students i used it enough to be considered active, Ki > Q[threshold]

select
	l.userid,count(l.id) as 'usage'
from 
	mdl_logstore_standard_log l, mdl_role_assignments r
where 
	r.userid = l.userid and r.roleid=5 
group by l.userid
having 
	count(l.id)>5;

4)
how many students actively use the system by school?
result from (3) grouped by cohort + textual aggregation

--------------------------------------SOLUTION 
-------OPT A

select
	l.userid,count(l.id) as 'usage',c.name
from 
	mdl_logstore_standard_log l, mdl_role_assignments r, mdl_cohort c, mdl_cohort_members cm
where 
	r.userid = l.userid and r.roleid=5 
	and cm.userid=l.userid and cm.cohortid=c.id
	and l.timecreated>=0 and l.timecreated<=1444173037
group by l.userid
having 
	count(l.id)>5;

select 
	c.name,c.id,cm.userid 
from 
	mdl_cohort c, mdl_cohort_members cm
where
	c.id = cm.cohortid;

5)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
number of logs               [per cohort]         [per day*]       [by students]
mdl_logstore_standard_log  mdl_cohort_members  /programmed/      mdl_role_assignments
select 
	l.userid, l.timecreated, cm.cohortid
from
	mdl_logstore_standard_log l,mdl_cohort_members cm, mdl_role_assignments r
where 
	l.userid=cm.userid and r.userid = l.userid
	and r.roleid=5;
